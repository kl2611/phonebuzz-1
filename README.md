# Phonebuzz
This is a Sinatra app using Ruby and TwiML to play FizzBuzz over the phone.

##Phase 1
Direct your Twilio phone number to https://phonebuzz-1.herokuapp.com/phonebuzz, and use HTTP GET request type. Call my demo Twilio number at +1 (347) 836-5066. A voice prompt will ask you to input a number between 1-99, followed by the '#' symbol.

##Phase 2
Point your Twilio phone number to https://phonebuzz-1.herokuapp.com/ with a HTTP GET request. Enter a phone number in the text field to receive a new call. Since this is a demo account, the number might not be called.

To download it locally, create a .env file with your Twilio auth token.

```ruby
ACCOUNT_SID=YOUR_ACCOUNT_SID_HERE
AUTH_TOKEN=YOUR_AUTH_TOKEN_HERE
```
